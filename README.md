# latex.nvim

(very) minimal, opinionated neovim filetype plugin for (La)TeX and Markdown, written in Lua.
There is no reason to prefer this plugin to [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex).

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
  "mathjiajia/latex.nvim",
  init = function()
    vim.g.latex_conf = {
      conceals = {
        enabled = {
          "amssymb",
          "core",
          "delim",
          "font",
          "greek",
          "math",
          -- "mleftright",
          "script",
        },
        add = {},
      },
      imaps = {
        enabled = false,
        add = {},
        default_leader = ";",
      },
      surrounds = {
        enabled = true,
        command = "c",
        math = "$",
        quotation = '"',
      },
      texlab = {
        enabled = true,
        build = "<M-b>",
        forward = "<M-f>",
        cancel_build = "<M-x>",
        close_env = "]]",
        change_env = "cse",
        toggle_star = "tse",
      },
    }
  end
}
```

## Requirements

To use `imaps`, which are based on [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter),
you must have treesitter parsers for the relevant filetype installed.
For example, `latex` for `.tex` files
and `markdown` and `markdown_inline` for `.md` files.

## Configuration

To use `latex.nvim` you need modify the global variable

```lua
vim.g.latex_conf
```

See below for more about configuring `imaps`.

## Features

### Imaps

Currently `latex.nvim` provides user-configurable, context-aware insert-mode mappings
in `.tex` and `.md` files.
The mappings are directly inspired by [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex).

The `imaps.add` table in `setup()` expects one of the following formats

```lua
{
  ["rhs"] = "lhs",
  -- the above is equivalent to
  ["rhs"] = {
  lhs = "lhs",
  leader = nil, -- will be replaced by default_leader
  wrap_char = false,
  context = nil -- will be replaced by one of require('latex').imaps.tex_math_mode or require('latex').imaps.markdown_math_mode
  }
}
```

Assuming a `default_leader` of "\`", typing "\`lhs" while within math mode
(e.g. between a pair of `$` or a `\[`, `\]` block in a `.tex` file,
or between a pair of `$$` in a `.md` file)
will yield an output of "rhs".

#### `wrap_char`

A mapping with `wrap_char = true`,
for example the default mapping

```lua
{
  ["\\mathbb"] = {
  lhs = "B",
  leader = "#",
  wrap_char = true
  }
 }
```

yields, after inputting "#BZ" in math mode, the output "\mathbb{Z}".

### Conceals

Almost all of the low-hanging fruit is done as far as concealing;
hard things like using tree-sitter for `\'e` to `é` are not a priority.

You can disable conceals on a per-file basis by redefining `conceals.enabled` in the `setup` function.

Currently the conceals provided are:

- Delim: things like `\left` and many instances of curly braces.
- Font: things like `\mathbb{Z}` to `ℤ`
- Greek: things like `\sigma` to `σ`
- Math: things like `\amalg` to `⨿`
- Script: superscripts and subscripts

You can add your own concealed commands to the `conceals.add` table in the following format

```lua
add = {
	["colon"] = ":",
}
```

The key should be the command name with the leading backslash stripped,
and the value should be the single-character conceal to replace that command with.
The `add` table is for concealing `generic_command` elements.
Unlike most other conceals, these are _not_ sensitive to the presence or absence of math mode.

### Surrounds

Requires [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround).
Provides `add`, `change` and `delete` for commands and environments.
With default settings for `nvim-surround`, these are mapped to,
for example, `csc` for `c`hange `s`urrounding `c`ommand and
`dse` for `d`elete `s`urrounding `e`nvironment.

To enable, set `surrounds.enabled` to `true`.

## Non-features

- compilation, forward/backward search, completion, linting—use [texlab](https://github.com/latex-lsp/texlab)
- highlighting—use treesitter
